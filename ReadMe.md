# Project Summary

In this project, I explored JavaScript by enhancing a static printing website with an interactive carousel. I started by exploring the fundamentals of JavaScript, a key programming language for creating dynamic web applications.
I have used Visual Studio Code for coding and Git / GitHub for version control.
