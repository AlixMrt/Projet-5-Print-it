# Project Summary

In this project, I learned JavaScript by making a static printing company's website more dynamic by adding an interactive carousel. My main task was to update the existing HTML code and integrate a carousel using JavaScript, giving me a better understanding of how JavaScript, HTML, and CSS interact to create interactive web elements. I used Visual Studio Code to manage my code and Git and GitHub for version control and hosting.
